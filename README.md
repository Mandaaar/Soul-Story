## 🧙 What Is This?

**SoulStory** is a whimsical web app that crafts a beautifully bizarre past life for you based on:

- Your **current mood**

Using this info, it spins a personalized tale set in ancient, futuristic, or completely imaginary timelines — all styled in a magical UI worthy of a Hogwarts common room.

## 🧙 What Is This?

**SoulStory** is a whimsical web app that crafts a beautifully bizarre past life for you based on:
- Your **birthdate**
- Your **favorite color**
- Your **current mood**
- Your **gender identity** (or… total mystery 🎭)

Using this info, it spins a personalized tale set in ancient, futuristic, or completely imaginary timelines — all styled in a magical UI worthy of a Hogwarts common room.
